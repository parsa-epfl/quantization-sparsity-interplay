# Effective Interplay between Sparsity and Quantization: From Theory to Practice

This repository is the official implementation of the code used for all analysis and experiments in the paper: Effective Interplay between Sparsity and Quantization: From Theory to Practice.

The paper mathematically investigates the relationship between quantization and sparsity techniques, and how their errors combine when both techniques are used together. The theoretical analysis is validated by experimental results on a wide range of models.

## Code Coming Soon!
We are excited to share our code with the community and are working on preparing it for release. Please stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your patience!

## About Our Work
Different forms of quantization and sparsity techniques have emerged as promising approaches to compress models, especially in the modern era of LLMs. This paper focuses on the combined application of both of these techniques, and is part of the broader research efforts to make the memopry footprint of LLMs smaller, and make them more accessible. For further details, we invite you to read the paper.
